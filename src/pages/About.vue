      >
      <br /><br />
      A brief summary about me, mostly about my skillset in technology,
      programming and management, but also about my hobbies and interests.
      <br /><br />
      Who Am I?
      <br /><br />
      Long time developer, primarily focused on the Backend and Database areas.
      My preferred Frontend frameworks are Vue.js and Microsoft Blazor.
      <br /><br />
      The lion's share of my career has been spent working with the Microsoft
      stack (C# / .NET / .NET Core / Microsoft SQL Server), but I have
      experience with a variety of languages, frameworks, and databases.
      <br /><br />
      I've held a number of positions in the span of my career:
      <ul>
        <li>Network Administrator</li>
        <li>Software Developer (Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead)</li>
        <li>Pseudo DBA</li>
        <li>DevOps Engineer</li>
        <li>Project Manager</li>
        <li>Team Lead</li>
        <li>Software Architect</li>
      </ul>
      I enjoy mentoring and teaching others, and helping them to grow in their
      careers. I am also a lifelong learner trying my best to keep my skills up
      to date. My PC is a mishmash of projects and technologies that I'm
      currently learning or working on.
