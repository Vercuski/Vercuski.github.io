        <p>Long time developer, primarily focused on the Backend and Database areas.
        My preferred Frontend frameworks are Vue.js and Microsoft Blazor.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The lion's share of my career has been spent working with the Microsoft
        stack (C# / .NET / .NET Core / Microsoft SQL Server), but I have
        experience with a variety of languages, frameworks, and databases.
        </p><br />
        <p>I've held a number of positions in the span of my career:</p>
        <ul class="ml-10">
          <li>Network Administrator</li>
          <li>Software Developer (Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead)</li>
          <li>Pseudo DBA</li>
          <li>DevOps Engineer</li>

        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>I enjoy mentoring and teaching others, and helping them to grow in their
        careers. I am also a lifelong learner trying my best to keep my skills up
        to date. My PC is a mishmash of projects and technologies that I'm
        currently learning or working on.</p>
